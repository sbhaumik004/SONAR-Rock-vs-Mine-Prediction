# SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction

 Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to classify sonar signals as either rock or mine based on their frequency patterns. The dataset consists of sonar returns bounced off metal cylinders (mines) and rocks, with each sample containing 60 numerical attributes representing frequency response.

Target Labels:
R → Rock
M → Mine

Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing:
Load dataset
Handle missing values (if any)

Normalize feature values
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Feature distribution visualization
Model Training & Evaluation:
Train/Test split
Machine learning algorithms tested:
Logistic Regression.
